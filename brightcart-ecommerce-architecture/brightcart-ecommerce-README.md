# BrightCart – Scalable Serverless E-Commerce Platform on AWS

This project demonstrates a full-scale, real-world AWS serverless architecture for **BrightCart Retail Group**, a fictional online retailer looking to modernize its e-commerce platform. The architecture is designed to be secure, scalable, highly available, and cost-optimized — capable of handling traffic spikes like Black Friday with zero downtime.
